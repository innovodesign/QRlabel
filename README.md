# QRlabel
QRCode serial labels for NVLink2

Use 19mm round labels on a A4 sheet.
Prints pairs of serial numbered labels, one with text+logo, other with QR code.

Currently only supports printing one page at a time.
Origin offsets are hard coded, so using different printers may require source code changes
Software version is hard coded, requires source code changes

Is would be nice to keep a log of prints
